# read in all the results files per subject
# generate one large "master" file that contains all the recordings of the experiments
# calculate the psychometric function for each participant, for each "trial_type", for each "standard_angle"
#       use the psignifit library for the calculations
# store the results (mean, slope) of the psychometric fit in the same data sheet
# plot psychometric functions in a Facetgrid using the seaborn library
